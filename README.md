This internship project aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of YouTube songs data using Power BI. 
The dataset contains key attributes such as video ID, channel title, title, description, tags, published date, 
view count, like count, favorite count, comment count, video duration, video definition, and caption 
details. The goal is to utilize Power BI to create insightful visualizations and reports that provide a deeper 
understanding of YouTube songs' performance, popularity, and user engagement. The analysis aims to 
uncover trends, preferences, and patterns in the data to aid content creators and stakeholders in 
optimizing their YouTube song content.
